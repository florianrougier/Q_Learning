# Q_Learning
Using Q Learning to find the best path in a maze going from a point A to a point B

## Improvements

I will try to improve this code in the near future to add more sprites and rewards and create a complex environment. In the meantime, for the algorithm, i will try to play with parameters (discount factor, learning rate and number of epochs).
